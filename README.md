## Backstory

Recently I applied to a front-end developer position at **DraftKings**.  During my initial contact with the recruiter over the phone, I was told of the responsibilities/duties of the position.  One responsibility of the role would be coming up with fresh and attractive website designs for movie-sponsored competitions.



(For the uninitiated, [DraftKings](http://www.draftkings.com) is a daily fantasy sports company. Participants in the service pay an entry fee to place bets on how they believe athletes will perform during their games that day.  The participants whose picks perform better than their peers’ win money and prizes,  alike standard betting/gambling wagers. Sometimes, companies, products, and movies advertise on DraftKings by allowing users to play contests for free by sponsoring the prizes of those contests.  The following is an example of a movie sponsored contest that was recently posted advertised on the DraftKings site.)

>The movie, [The Belko Experiment](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1082807/), was sponsoring a free-to-enter, $10,000 competition for DraftKings back in February/March.



After my initial phone screen on a Wednesday and a follow-up phone interview that following Friday, I was invited to an onsite interview next Wednesday (a week after initial contact).  In between me getting invited to the interview and showing up for it, I came up with the idea to create and design a sponsored DraftKings page and show it off to my interviewers on Wednesday as proof of my talents/capabilities.

Although I was not able to present the project during my interview because I did not finish in time, I still wanted to complete my work.



## Resources Used

I want to clearly state what in my design is original and what is taken and/or inspired by other sources.  

First off, I copied much of the styling and images from the DraftKings homepage.  The whole idea for this project was to incorporate in a movie advertisement into their pre-existing web page and its design.  Therefore, I went to the DraftKings home page, went into the DOM via "Inspect Element", and retrieved all of the import images and css files from their website and rebuilt it into mine.  I also made React Components out of all of the home page elements.

>Secondly, the [Kong: Skull Island](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3731562/) art I created was inspired by one of the posters for the movie.
